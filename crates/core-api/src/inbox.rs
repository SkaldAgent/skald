//! Inbox API exposed to plugins.
//!
//! The Skald `Inbox` façade (src/core/inbox.rs) wraps the `ApprovalManager` and
//! `ClarificationManager`. Plugins receive `Arc<dyn InboxApi>` via `PluginContext`
//! and use it to read pending items and resolve them, without depending on the
//! main crate. `request_id` is the integer rowid used both for resolution and
//! for idempotency (plugin.md §2): `approve`/`reject`/`answer` on an already
//! resolved id are no-ops.
